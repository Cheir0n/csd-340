                        I like to watch almost any movie.  I particularly like sfy-fi and fantasy movies.  They are an escape from the real world.  I can get lost in them and 
                        simply enjoy the tale being told.

                        As an Operations Lead I was put in charge of RTVs(defectives), transfer ins/outs, and claims. I daily went through all paperwork concerning transfers to 
                        make sure they had been received and followed up on those that had not been received. I unloaded the freight truck in the morning as well as seperated and 
                        processed the freight.  On average we received 2 trucks a week.  There were times when I was the only manager in the store and was responsible for its daily 
                        operations.  I have trained muliple people in becoming Freight Flow Leads (the newest title for Operations Lead) for other stores.  I have also trained 
                        District Managers and Loss Prevention Managers in what I did.  Our District Loss Prevention Manager refers everyone with questions concerning operations and 
                        the Freight Flow Lead aspect of the company to me.  One store manager even asked me to transfer with him to a new store that he was opening.

                        I also: performed employee appraisals, wrote weekly employee schedule, talked to employees regarding poor performance/behavioral problems/commend good behavior, and 
                        ensured proper training of new employees.
